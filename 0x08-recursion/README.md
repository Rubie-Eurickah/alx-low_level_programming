C - Recursion

This Project is on Recursion in C programming. Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts.

1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together

Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

Write a function that returns the length of a string.

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen.

3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

- If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
- Factorial of 0 is 1

4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

- If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

FYI: The standard library provides a different function: pow.

5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

- If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1

FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt.

6. Inception. Is it possible?

Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything

Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

- An empty string is a palindrome

8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

- s2 can contain the special character *.
- The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
